    <h1> What is jQuery? </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</li>

        <li>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</li>

        <li>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</li>
        
        <li>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</li>
    </ul> <hr>
